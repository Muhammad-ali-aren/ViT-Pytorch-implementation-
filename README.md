# ViT Pytorch implementation

This repository contains a clean and modular implementation of the **Vision Transformer (ViT)** architecture from scratch using PyTorch. Inspired by the original paper: ["An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929).

The project follows best practices for training, including patch embeddings, multi-head self-attention, learning rate warmup, and cosine decay.
